question to ask as biologist: 
    why have a brain?
        you do better when you can predict what happens in the future
        animals can predict and manipulate the environment FASTER by having a brain
*it doesn't matter, it's just arbitrary whether a sponge can be classified as an animal
        EXPENSIVE: brain itself is 20% or 20W of bodie's energy - joules/sec
        rather than care of bits/sec, nature cares about bits/joule because of conserving nrg
        
neuroscience needed to know:
    we only care about neurons, not glia
    
    THE NEURON
        input structure: dendrites bring it all together into the soma
        output structure: axons send it out
        
        structure that connects axons to dendrites: synapse
        transducer: postsynaptic site

our definition of computation: 
* is this mccullogh-pitts neuron?

    input where:    i represents inputs, 
                    k represents discrete time increments (simulations)
                    t represents continuous time (actual brain)
            X_i(k)
            X_i(t)
            X_i(k) is elem of {0,1} because it can be either on or off

            how to represent finite numbers as a continuous input, use the rate of pulses
            brain uses interpulse interval code to send rational numbers

            WE WILL USE X_i(k) isElem {0,1} for computational purposes in matlab

LINEAR ALGEBRA:

    all our vectors will be column vectors
    x(k)  = |   x_1(k)  |
            |   x_2(k)  |
            |   .....   |
            |   x_nx(k) |
    
   w_j(k) = |  w_1(j)  |
            |  w_2(j)  |
            |  .....   |
            |  w_ij(k) |

  y_j(k)  = summation(i) [W_ij * X_i(k)]

  z_j(k) = {0,1  if y_j(k)>= theta --> 1

  inner product scalar product
  * see picture on blackboard
* why do you have to transpose the vector twice? 

        y_j(k) = w_j ^t * x(k) = X^t(k) * W_j

    matrix W

        x^T(k) * W = y^T(k)
        
        transpose again
        W^Tx(k) = y(k)

^^^ ** THIS IS A FEEDFORWARD MECHANISM

definition of a vector based off mathematics: a vector is a point

because neurons are computing in higher dimensional spaces that we can't imagine

another job of neuron is pattern recognition
   
    higher dimensional sphere for characteristics of representing baseball vs basketball player
    convert the heuristic into a higher-dimensional shape 
    network: learn to create two separate spheres that could even touch in places

    vector of a point that represents a dot within a higher dimensional shape
    
**    PATTERN RECOGNITION DECIDES WHERE THE POINT BELONGS!!!

* information theory get basic info

more terms:

    representation: abstract
    latent variable: everything we want to make inferences about is hidden

    experience = the actual world + noise of sensory signals

    WHY have lots of layers? the data might not be in good shape
    
    problem harder than studying the brain: because the world is made up of many brains, the world is much more complex than the brain.
    it is thus extremely hard to make a mathematical model of the world

    the xor problem: can you pass a single plane that groups Xs together away from Os

    to create a hyperplane to represent the threshold of a real-world problem

cognition:

    abstraction: with a bunch of examples of class A and class B, you know multiple classes exist
    generalization: after seeing something new, deciding what class it falls under
    concept formation:
    clustering:
    pattern: set of features
        lots of patterns -> leads to an attempt to group them which leads to concept formation
    prototype: center of cluster concept

    prediction/forecasting: actually in the future
    estimation: retrodiction of past
