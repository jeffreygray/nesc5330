LEARNING AND MEMORY
-------------------

difference equation for associative memory:
    /\ w_j(k) = summation (x(k) - w_j(k) * y_j(k)
                          presynaptic     postsynaptic

scalar exponential moving averager
    /\ w(k) = summation (x(k) - w(k))
              rate const
                units/sec
    
    w(k+1) = w(k) + /\w(k)  
    newval   oldval    change

moving average depends on:
    1. number that is an abstraction of past samples
    2. current sample
    3. rate constant, epsilon

q1: express current value of memory based off the history of inputs
(see appendix p21) 

exponential forgetting: m(t+1) = eps sum(k=0, inf) (1-eps) ^k * x(t-k)
