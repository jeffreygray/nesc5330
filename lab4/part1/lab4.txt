create synapses that are modified moving averagers (like in lab3)
synaptic weights will converge to its approx average - conditional average

step 1: create single category input whose value is represented by z_j
    when j is present, z_j = 1

lab stuff:

given input set of three vectors on unit circle, {pi/6, pi/4, pi/3}, and weights [.5, .5]

draw inputs from set of possible values

use three postsynaptic neurons 

data input arrives as vector [z; x_1; x_2] (category state and feature state)

A) start synaptic weights at 0, observe their change as a function of input presentations
AFTER the values have nearly converged, test the network's response to input features without category info

    1) describe how i define convergence and graphically illustrate with 2 examples
    2) quantitatively describe the response of each neuron to the various feature vectors
    3) describe data that indicate convergences
