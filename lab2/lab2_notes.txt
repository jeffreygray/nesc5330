task: build a neuron to execute pattern recognition / categorization

credo:
    if a microscopic neurobiological process can perform
    an abstract version of a cognitive process (pattern rec, concept form),
    then this cognitive f(n) is preserved when a larger system is
    built from the component

the mcculloch-pitts neuron:
        BOOLEAN DECISION MAKER
    x(k) : input vector of components x_1(k), x_2(k)... x_n(k)

        feature detectors

    w_j  : postsynaptic neuron
    kth excitation of j : y_j = x^T(k) * w_j
                                output: z_j(k) =    {1 if y_j >= threshold, or 0}
    let j elemOf {1, 2, ... m}
    
grandmother code:
    with 7 elements
    2^7 possibilities of output vectors
    {0, 1}^7

types of errors:
    type 1: failure to identify 
    type 2: false positive

how to generate length 1 vecs
v^T(k)v(k) = 1

for every input, there exists a plane:
        origin
        weight vector (w_j)
        input vector (x(k))
    angle btwn weight and input
        cos(angle) describes similarity
            a normalized inner product
    arclength bwtn weight and input

sqrt sum squares
    euclidean length

setting thresholds:
    excitation
        y_j = x^T(k) * w(j)
            OR
        y_j = dot(x(k), w(j))

    draw perpendicular line from w_j to point x(k)

    the larger theta is, the smaller the angle that defines 
        the set of recognized inputs
