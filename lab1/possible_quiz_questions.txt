1. MATLAB uses = for assignment 
	B = A stores elements of A into B

2. how to use for loop to update current avg while iterating through vector

function average = doit(a,b)
traversed = [];
for v = a:b 
    traversed(end+1) = v;
    average = sum(traversed) / size(traversed,2);
end


3.  
a = 50;
b = 100;
r = (b-a).*rand(1000,1) + a;
r = scale.*rand(elem,1) + shift

relative frequency histogram: normalized hist where sum(bin_vals) = 1
